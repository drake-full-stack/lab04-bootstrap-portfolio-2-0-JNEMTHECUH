        <h2>Concerts & Live Music</h2>
        <p>I <strong>love</strong> going to concerts, the energy of a live crowd is unbeatable.</p>
        <p>one of my selfies will go here at some point</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My big 3: <em>Juice Wrld, Los Tigres del Norte, Kid Cudi</em></li>
            <li>Best concert I’ve been to: Juice Wrld at Summer Smash in 2019, RIP</li>
            <li>Dream show: I wish I got to see Ozzy Osbourne before his passing, RIP. Otherwise I have seen almost every artist ive ever loved!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Comics & Anime</h2>
        <p>Im a huge fan of marvel comics and have been getting into DC more recently. <br>What really gets me talking though is anime, here are my big 3: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>One Piece</b> - Caught up on all 1141 episodes, its not long enough! I'm stuck making theories of my own.</li>
            <li><b>Hunter X Hunter</b> = This show really changed my outlook on anime and impacted me in a big way when I was younger.</li>
            <li><b>Attack on Titan</b> - All I can say is <b>Global Impact Award</b>, are you kidding me? 10/10</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And an honorable mention to Solo leveling, it's just peak animation.</p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Gaming is one of my favorite ways to relax and connect with friends. Here are a few I love:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pokémon Unite</strong> - my main is Zacian, but he gets fried if I don’t play smart.</li>
            <li><strong>Warthunder</strong> - nothing like a good tank battle or a dogfight.</li>
            <li><strong>Ghosts of Tabor VR</strong> - super intense and immersive raid extraction game that never gets old.</li>
        </ul>
